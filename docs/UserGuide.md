## Key Terms

TA Toolkit stores students' contact details and allows the user to take notes on students and track their attendance.
As such, it is important that you familiarise yourself with the structure of each person as well as their key attributes (notes, attendance).

### Person

A person represents your student. At the start of the teaching semester, you should add your students' basic contact details (NAME, CLASS_GROUP, EMAIL).

A person has the following attributes:
- Name (Compulsory)
- Class_Group (Compulsory)
- Email address (Compulsory)
- Phone number (Optional)
- Telegram handle (Optional)
- Github ID (Optional)
- Attendance (Tracked by the application)
- Notes (Tracked by the application)

In TA Toolkit, duplicating entries with identical email addresses, phone numbers, Telegram handles, or GitHub IDs is not supported. The comparison of these fields for equality is case-insensitive. Therefore, you cannot add multiple individuals sharing the same email, phone number, Telegram handle, or GitHub ID.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Tip:**
After adding a student's contact, update their phone number, telegram handle, github ID after finding those out from your students.

</box>

### Attendance

Each student has an attendance for each week tied to him. Since NUS semesters contain 13 weeks, TA Toolkit only supports taking attendance for 13 weeks.
When a student contact is added to TA Toolkit, he is assumed to be present for all 13 weeks.
You can use the [`ma`](#marking-attendance-ma) command to mark a student as present or absent for a specific week.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Tip:**
Use negative marking to quickly take attendance for a class. Since all students are initially assumed to be present,
you can quickly the attendace of an entire class by only marking the absentees as absent.

</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Commands are case-sensitive.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `ac n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `ac n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TELEGRAM]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/@johndoe` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Items with … after them can be used multiple times (1 or more).<br>
  For example, the `ls CLASS_GROUP` command can be used to search 1 `CLASS_GROUP` like `ls T10`, or 2 `CLASS_GROUP`s like `ls T10 T20`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* For any command that fails to executed, refer to the Result Display, which will provide a helpful explanation to help you correct your command.
  ![Result_Display](images/ErrorMessage_example.png)

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Tip:** To quickly mark attendance of the class for the week, use [ls](#listing-persons-ls) command to list all students in the class.
Then, mark the absentees for the week as absent. Since all students are initially assumed to be present, only the absentees will be marked as absent.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TAToolkit will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TAToolkit to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I see the attendance or notes of a specific student?<br>
**A**: You have to use the [`view`](#viewing-a-person-view) command to view the detailed information containing the notes and attendance of person.
For example, if you want to view the attendance of the 1st person in the displayed person list, use the `view 1` command to view his/her detailed information.

**Q**: How do I see the overall attendance for a specific class?<br>
**A**: You have to use the [`ls`](#listing-persons-ls) command to list all the persons for a specific class.
The overall attendance of the class will be displayed in the side panel display.

**Q**: Why can't I see the application even though it is open?<br>
**A**: When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen,
and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen.
The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous TAToolkit home folder.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Caution:**
If the tatoolkit.json file is invalid or has any formatting errors, the program might not start up. Please make sure
that the tatoolkit.json file used is **correct and accurate.**

</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Common mistakes

1. **When [adding contacts](#adding-a-person-ac) or [updating contacts](#updating-a-person-uc)**,
if the command causes 2 persons in the TA Toolkit to have the same `EMAIL`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `TELEGRAM`, or `GITHUB`,
the command will fail. This is because every contact should have unique `EMAIL`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `TELEGRAM`, and `GITHUB`.

2. **When [updating contacts](#updating-a-person-uc), [deleting contacts](#deleting-a-person-dc)**,
i.e. any commands that utilises the `INDEX` parameter, the command is interacting with the wrong contact.
The `INDEX` must match the current index of the person on the displayed person list. Should you find yourself updating/ deleting the wrong person,
ensure you adhere to the index presently shown, rather than an index from a past view.

To reset the displayed person list, you can refer to the [`ls`](#listing-persons-ls) command.
