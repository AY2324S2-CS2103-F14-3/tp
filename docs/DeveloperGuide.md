## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280"></puml>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tatoolkit/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tatoolkit/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `dc 1` to delete a person.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/ay2324s2-cs2103t-f14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tatoolkit/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, 'SidePanel' etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/ay2324s2-cs2103t-f14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tatoolkit/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/ay2324s2-cs2103t-f14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/ay2324s2-cs2103t-f14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tatoolkit/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("dc 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `TaToolkitParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TaToolkitParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TaToolkitParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tatoolkit/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the TA Toolkit data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/ay2324s2-cs2103t-f14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/tatoolkit/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both TA Toolkit data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TaToolkitStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.tatoolkit.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Edit a `Person`

Edits the details of an existing `Person` identified by their `INDEX`in the displayed person list.
The commands are implemented in the `EditCommand` class which extend the `Command` class.

* Step 1. The `EditCommand` object's `execute()` method is called.
* Step 2. The `INDEX` is checked to be within the valid range of the displayed person list. If the `INDEX` given is invalid (i.e., out of range), a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 3. The `Person` at the given `INDEX` is referenced and `deletePerson()` is called to remove `originalPerson` from person list.
* Step 4. The field(s) to be edited are checked.
  * If there are no fields to be edited, a `CommandException` is thrown.
  * If any of the edited fields are invalid, a `CommandException` is thrown.
  * If the edited person is the same as the original person, a `CommandException` is thrown`.
  * If any of `Email`, `Phone`, `Telegram`, `Github` fields are duplicates with any existing person in person list, a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 5. The model object's `addPerson()` method is called. The input parameter is the `editedPerson` with the edited details.
* Step 6. The `Person` field(s) are edited.

The diagram below describes this behaviour concisely. It shows how a user’s command is processed and what message is ultimately shown if they decide to edit a person.

<puml src="diagrams/EditCommandActivityDiagram.puml" />

The sequence diagram below also shows the interaction between the various components during the execution of the `EditCommand`.

<puml src="diagrams/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How editing a Person works:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Removes the `originalPerson` and adds the `editedPerson`.
    * Pros: Retains the sorted order of Persons by `Name` in the person list.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of time complexity since it requires 2 operations (`deletePerson()` and `addPerson`).

* **Alternative 2:** Directly update the fields in the `originalPerson`
    * Pros: Better performance, since this only requires searching through the person list once.
    * Cons: The order of person list will be lost, since `Name` of a `Person` may be edited.

### View a `Person`

Views the details of an existing `Person` identified by their `INDEX`in the displayed person list.
The commands are implemented in the `ViewCommand` class which extend the `Command` class.

* Step 1. The `ViewCommand` object's `execute()` method is called.
* Step 2. The `INDEX` is checked to be within the valid range of the displayed person list. If the `INDEX` given is invalid (i.e., out of range), a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 3. The `Person` at the given `INDEX` is referenced and then displayed to the user on the right side panel.

The diagram below describes this behaviour concisely. It shows how a user’s command is processed and what message is ultimately shown if they decide to view a person.

<puml src="diagrams/ViewCommandActivityDiagram.puml" />

The sequence diagram below also shows the interaction between the various components during the execution of the `ViewCommand`.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTaToolkit`. It extends `TaToolkit` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `taToolkitStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedTaToolkit#commit()` — Saves the current TA Toolkit state in its history.
* `VersionedTaToolkit#undo()` — Restores the previous TA Toolkit state from its history.
* `VersionedTaToolkit#redo()` — Restores a previously undone TA Toolkit state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitTaToolkit()`, `Model#undoTaToolkit()` and `Model#redoTaToolkit()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedTaToolkit` will be initialized with the initial TA Toolkit state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single TA Toolkit state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `dc 5` command to delete the 5th person in the TA Toolkit. The `dc` command calls `Model#commitTaToolkit()`, causing the modified state of the TA Toolkit after the `dc 5` command executes to be saved in the `taToolkitStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted TA Toolkit state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `ac n/David …​` to add a new person. The `ac` command also calls `Model#commitTaToolkit()`, causing another modified TA Toolkit state to be saved into the `taToolkitStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitTaToolkit()`, so the TA Toolkit state will not be saved into the `taToolkitStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoTaToolkit()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous TA Toolkit state, and restores the TA Toolkit to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial TaToolkit state, then there are no previous TaToolkit states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoTaToolkit()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoTaToolkit()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the TA Toolkit to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `taToolkitStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest TA Toolkit state, then there are no undone TaToolkit states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoTaToolkit()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `ls`. Commands that do not modify the TA Toolkit, such as `ls`, will usually not call `Model#commitTaToolkit()`, `Model#undoTaToolkit()` or `Model#redoTaToolkit()`. Thus, the `taToolkitStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitTaToolkit()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `taToolkitStateList`, all TA Toolkit states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire TA Toolkit.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `dc`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

Team Size: 5

### Better name validation

**Background**: Currently, TA Toolkit only allows contacts' name to contain alphanumeric characters and spaces.

**Issue**: The strict restrictions will prevent some valid names from being accepted.
For example, "Ravi S/O Ramasamy" is rejected as it contains a '/' character.

**Enhancement**: We plan on changing the parameter prefixes to use the '=' character instead of the '/' character.
Furthermore, we will loosen the restrictions on names to allow the '/' character.
This will allow the TA Toolkit to accept legal names containing the '/' character.

### Better email validation

**Background**: Currently, our system validates email addresses using the format local-part@domain, with specific restrictions for both parts to identify and reject invalid emails.

**Issue**: This validation method does not strictly adhere to the IETF standards for email addresses.
Consequently, our application may incorrectly deem invalid emails as valid.
For instance, an email like a@12.34 may pass validation despite having a domain that violates IETF standards.
Furthermore, while our validation accommodates formats commonly used by major email service providers like Google, Outlook, Hotmail, and Yahoo, the IETF's standards are more inclusive and may recognize additional formats.

**Enhancement**: To address this issue, we aim to enhance our email validation process to align more closely with IETF standards and specific RFCs such as RFC3696, RFC5322, and RFC6854.
This upgrade be able to accurately identify valid and invalid email addresses.

### Better identification of unique students

**Background**: Currently, TA Toolkit does not have a unique identifier to identify unique students.
There is only weak checking done to ensure students do not have duplicate email, phone number, telegram, github.

**Issue**: TAs might have difficulty differentiating between students with the same name.
This is a problem when looking at the attendance overview, when the TA sees a name as absent. If 2 people share that name, the TA does not know which of them is absent.

**Enhancement**: We plan on adding Student ID as a field for students, which will be the unique identifier for student contacts.
When displaying the attendance overview, the Student ID will accompany the student's name to uniquely identify him.

### More comprehensive attendance taking

**Background**: Currently, TA Toolkit only allows TAs to mark their students as present or absent.

**Issue**: This introduces confusion to the TA, when marking attendance for students with other attendance status.
For example, some students might be absent with valid reasons, like being on medical leave.

**Enhancement**: We plan on introducing more attendance statuses that TAs can mark their students with, like being absent with valid reason.

### Handling duplicate keys in JSON object

**Background**: Currently, TA Toolkit does not check for duplicate keys in JSON objects used for storage of student contact details.

**Issue**: This could lead to unexpected behaviour if the storage file is corrupted.
For example, if the JSON object representing the student contact details contains 2 `name` keys, the application should throw an error that the data is corrupted.
However, the application reads the value of the last duplicate key.

**Enhancement**: We plan on introducing checks to ensure that there are no duplicate keys for any of the JSON objects in the storage file.
This will cause TA Toolkit to throw an error and reset the data if the storage file is invalid.
