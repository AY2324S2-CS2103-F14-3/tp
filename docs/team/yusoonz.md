### Project: TaToolkit Level 3

TaToolkit - Level 3 is a desktop application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add/delete notes for each student in TaToolkit.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add customized notes to each student of their choice.
  * Justification: This feature significantly improves the product, as it helps ease the mental burden of TAs in CS2100. It allows them to add unique notes to each student, reminding themselves of what they wish to take note of regarding the student.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands. It also had to fit into the wider design architecture to ensure it worked with other commands like the `viewCommand`.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view students in TaToolkit.
  * What it does: Allows the user to view a student of their choice stored within TaToolkit.
  * Justification: This feature significantly improves the product as it allows TAs to view and retrieve their students' details, such as Telegram, email, or GitHub IDs, should they need to contact them quickly.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands. It also had to fit into the wider design architecture to ensure it worked with other commands like the `editCommand`.
